<section class="gaga-section">
  <p>We collaborated with Lady Gaga to release an app that would accompany her new album, ARTPOP.</p>

  <p>The ARTPOP app was meant to be a meeting point for fans and Gaga herself. We chose to design the app to be a creative space for her fans to create artwork, listen to the new album, and a hub for chatting with others fans.</p>
